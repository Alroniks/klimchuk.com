I saw format in blog of [Artem Sapegin](http://birdwatcher.ru/blog/5756/). So, some of the facts, events and achievements in 2014:

&mdash; Studied DocPad generator and create [my website](https://github.com/Alroniks/klimchuk.com) in two languages on it, simultaneously sending a couple of [pull requests](https://github.com/docpad/docpad/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AAlroniks+is%3Aclosed) to DocPad.

&mdash; Leave a warm place at Onliner.by and went to do own business, what I do now. Not everything went as seen in the beginning, but full of bumps added experience and new ideas only increased. I think it is an invaluable experience and everyone should at least try.

&mdash; I graduated courses in English, level Pre-Intermediate (A2). Level is not the highest, but the result is visible.

&mdash; After languages courses my level allowed me to get [my first order](http://beckettagricultural.co.uk/) from UK. A new experience is always good.

&mdash; Organized and conducted the first for me and the first in Belarus [MODX Meetup](http://modxby.timepad.ru/event/130653/).

&mdash; Written and produced 3 components for MODX to receive payments: [mspWebPay](https://store.simpledream.ru/packages/ecommerce/mspwebpay.html), [mspAssistBelarus](https://store.simpledream.ru/packages/ecommerce/mspassistbelarus.html), [mspPayU](https://store.simpledream.ru/packages/ecommerce/msppayu.html).

&mdash; First [visit to Bulgaria](https://vk.com/album3538967_202846882), was there on vacation.

&mdash; [Rode](http://178.124.171.167/cgi-bin/Results.pl?evid=17) my first brevet - 200 km on a usual Trek 3500.

&mdash; Traveled by car half the perimeter of Belarus in May on the route Minsk-Grodno-Narach-Polotsk-Vitebsk-Mogilev-Minsk.

&mdash; Went to [the highest point in Belarus](http://instagram.com/p/n3LyORnVM_/).

&mdash; Launched new version of site of community [MODX Belarus](https://modx.by)

And many others, that I've already forgot.
